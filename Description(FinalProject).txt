In this game we hame 4 tier of fishing rod. Each rod has own chances for fish and begining with mk2 has a special ability.
mk0 rod you start with.
mk1 have better chances.
mk2 have better chances then mk 1 and have ability to double your reward.
mk3 have all features mk2 rised chaced and new ability. Ability is every 4 action it will give 1 additional fish.
And of course all buffs is additive. That mean if you have fishing rod mk3 you have all buffs other rods.
